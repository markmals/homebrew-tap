  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      remctl reads your local Reminders database directly and writes through
      Apple's EventKit / ReminderKit APIs, so macOS privacy permissions are
      required before it can do anything useful:

        * Full Disk Access — grant it to the terminal you run remctl from
          (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access). remctl
          reads the Reminders store under ~/Library/Group Containers, which
          is TCC-protected.
        * Reminders access — approved on first write, or run: remctl onboard

      Check your setup at any time:
          remctl doctor

      Permissions are per-app: a green `remctl doctor` in one terminal does not
      grant access to a different terminal, app, or agent runner.
